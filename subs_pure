hello friends we are going to help improve the world together gonna have
fun we're gonna learn a lot together and help make the things we value in this
world more available and help remove problems imagine a world where humans
did not have to worry about other humans imagine we had only non-human rats to
deal with large rats that take away from that which all of us value and that is
health right we all want to be healthy and so we're going to use we're going to
use information and energy to make the world better help make the world better
with others that are already doing the fields that we will use we're gonna use
tech math science these together are very powerful most everything most
people enjoy in their lives good food insulation from harsh environments like
your the internet our results of these fields and we are going to use these
fields part of the science that we are going to do we're gonna use computer
science we're going to use economic this is about computing and information in
general and how to create technology that can manipulate information and help
us achieve any goal we want that is possible economics the science of
decision-making under constraints we all live under constraints and so we make
decisions based on that that is studied in economics sociology that is going to
be of course a key subject that studies human structures if a human could be
represented as a dot just for simplification then structures between
humans are studied in sociology other sciences and also of course be useful in
considering individual humans like psychology and all of this we're gonna
wrap in philosophy we're gonna use philosophy which is close to math math
is formal philosophy and everything that we do here we're going to prove and
formalize and yes though this is the learning part we're gonna have this is a
movement we are going to change and do this not just learn we are going to
prove why this is an important change and why the solution is the correct one
that we will be finding using one thing that we will never abandon and that is
logic we will always base ourselves on logic based on logic we're going to find
using science the largest human rights oppressions and using tech and math we
will prove correct solutions and solve these problems this is course meant as
it is a movement as a community you friends and I me are going to go on an
adventure to help improve the world and do that together I know you can enjoy
just listening to me that already is you helping and there are more ways that you
can help and by helping you will by the way reap the reward that most humans
really value and that is helping other humans why because we are social and no
human survives alone it is human society that dominates the planet not any
individual human no human has ever survived alone and even an attempt of a
human adult to survive alone comes at the benefit of knowledge coming from
human society let me show you some very simple ways that you can help rent you
see the large number here there's a timestamp this is the number a
timestamp just marks the time it's a number of seconds since a specific time
arbitrary but specific in the past if you comment anywhere with two numbers we
will cut it out automatically from this long stream from all long streams and
make a short out of it and it will go to Instagram take talk etc that is us being
efficient instead of one person editing the stream find the good spots worthy of
short we can distribute and decentralize this task so if you anywhere comment on
this YouTube on reddit anywhere we see it Twitter adding the account will get
to it and you comment two numbers the beginning number let's say what we have
now eight one three two one seven oh eight two oh eight one four that's one
set so maybe that's less interesting let's say I made it eight twenty that's
seven sex if you just comment this a number timestamp hold on cool another
number then we'll have this as a short going out could be this also if you want
to concatenate multiple shorter clips like could be you want there was a gap
that is not good to have so you want to have this and this but they
concatenated together into one short adding them very easy same thing
whatever your number is right like imagine one seven let me do this in the
other color one seven etc was eight thirteen to one seven etc to a twenty
comma okay that's that's the protocol comma the next one one seven etc maybe
eight twenty five two one seven etc 830 that's another five five seconds in this
exam three sec the whole thing will be eight seconds long and you can keep
adding Thomas if you want and keep adding for things this is you helping to
create short format as people do but this is super easy you don't need a
video editor you don't need any you just need to comment the numbers that were
interesting to you you can also force classically like share your friends
subscribe talk about it all of that is you helping why do we have Wikipedia
showing by the way is there a connection to video here everything that we will be
doing we will be doing based on knowledge but not just you know which
knowledge everyone has some knowledge and different people could come to
different conclusions based on their own knowledge on what better vision
important is reliable much has to be reliable what is knowledge knowledge is
the ability to see the future predicted if someone claims to have knowledge of
the weather climate I understand I know based on the current conditions what
kind of weather we will more we would say this person has knowledge and we
could ask and test the knowledge of this person by having the person predict the
future and then seeing how the future goes and different people might make
different predictions on based on their own knowledge predicting different
futures and the one that would more accurately and precisely predict the
future would be the one we would say has more reliable knowledge and is the one
we would we should rather listen to reliable knowledge is the basis of our
philosophy we get to that before I do that perhaps I send a message about this
being live on to place that I had prepared that was reddit and X we are
going to talk philosophically about what knowledge is what reliable knowledge is
to make sure that we're doing the right thing this is now just an outlook of what
we will do over time we're gonna talk about of course about me as well I'm
going to explain who I am and why I can be trusted and why I am doing this this
isn't will be an important part we will talk about methods of actually finding
the largest problems in the world how to optimize what is important and then
solving will be solving this is methods to find and to solve but we will be
solving but also we will be creating a lot of tech for different things and
this tech will have of course valued this tech will have value and there's
different things so we will see that we will figure out that currently the top
human rights oppression in the world is going to concern a certain people and we
want to help this group of people and this group of people as some forums
where they are existing for support and communicating for support and some of
these forums are all of these forums are important and some of these forums have
some fragility and potential of censorship and so we're going to use
tech to create backups essentially you know of existing forums the most
important one there's one especially we're gonna work on creating a backup
and for a forum and all of this is going to be by the way decentralized all of
this will be centralized what does that mean that means trustless that means you
can trust the system without needing to trust any not even any of the creators
not even me see the code open source and goes now we'll explain of course this
entire world of decentralization or trustlessness or web reads another term
for this and I know that I know that many people currently have some fear
inhibition about this for good reason sorry I should take that back for there
is a reason for that there have been lots of scams in that word however I
will explain why the technology itself does not has nothing to do with the
problematic actors permits there in fact the other way around it allows actually
but if users actually use this advantage of everything necessarily being open
source all code that actually allows for trustlessness we can actually create and
audit and then have systems that nobody can censor and compromise we are going
to create technology that is going to help not only with specific causes that
we're looking at fighting for but generally for the world for example
there is a trust less true protocol okay which solves fake news okay fake news is
a big problem and will become a larger and larger problem and there is a
trustless true protocol how social truth can be defined mathematically and that
by the way has won an award recently and we're going to set that up to allow
humans to figure out truth especially making transparent what other human
groups think we're going to create similar decentralized non-censorable
technology to actually solve the human rights problems by maximizing awareness
for the problem we're going to identify or of the problem and find a solution
and solve it with non-censorable trustless technology so that's kind of
some look ahead just rearranging
here we go so I was saying why Wikipedia was the connection so what is our
philosophy generally if you this is the part you need to agree this is the basic
thinking and I will make a case for it what is our philosophy we believe only
with good reason and we are allowed to and encouraged to learn that means we're
allowed to change our mind anytime we think we have better understanding
better knowledge better information and in fact learning is that which
differentiates us from inanimate objects like a stone or a table our DNA our mind
we can learn and a stone and not and that is our main advantage that is what
we should constantly be doing that is what enables improvement is there even
if there is even such a thing and we will define it formally and write it out
what it means improvement yes there is such a thing and it is only possible
through learning we are learning beings and that is what we do well that is what
we should do and we should only believe something if we have good reason to
believe it that has been shown to be a very good principle because we know that
false information does exist like we can say things that are false that are
logically false that means if you get some information you shouldn't
automatically believe it might be possible for it to be false so you
should only believe it if it is true as in there's a good reason to believe it
and it being true is a good reason this philosophy has a name it's called
science this is what it is and this is the base philosophy that we will follow
and I once again have adjust
how set this up with my slides so yeah I made essentially a mistake and that is
also really important to understand that this is a community it is also a
community me and you the community is led by me very important what is and I'm
kind of jumping ahead now but very important community is something that we
will define what does it even mean is a part of sociology of the science of
sociology and very important here is that I the leader in me can be wrong and
exit is free from the community that's very important entry is free as well
and there's a lot of communities that have free entry by listening you are a
friend we are friends and we are in the community and the community is doing
cool things I'm going to talk about the movement after important though is that
since you are easily in the community you should also easily be able to go out
if you ever disagree if you ever don't like something you need to be able to go
out really this is a very important principle and we will show why not
having this condition leads to problems in society and essentially solving for
this actually and we'll do all the all this formally no bit by bits step by
step we'll go through it'll be all simple enough if you listen and listen
again and I listen and speak and think we'll see step by step why this
logically would lead to humanity that doesn't need to worry about other humans
all united against much larger threats to our health right now we have those
threats as well as well as other humans humans attacking different groups of
humans there are groups of humans that are hacking other groups of humans and
that is not necessary and utopian as it sounds it's we're going to show how to
do it and create even the technology that will bring us in that direction and
Amy can be wrong what is the important part about that is that Amy is a
scholar I am scholar I have studied a lot and scholars or people who spend
time studying something on average should understand that topic better on
average a scholar versus non scholar the scholar should on average understand
better so if you took the average scholar of the scholars in the world
versus non scholars in some topic in that topic the scholars should know
better to have better and more reliable knowledge otherwise scholarship that is
and by school being a scholar I mean being a student studying would be
counterproductive if people that study let's say knew less than people that
don't then if their knowledge were less reliable then no one would study so
scholars on average have more reliable knowledge in me I have been a scholar or
a long time in the relevant fields for this and so that's why Amy is leading
this movement and community at the same time is important versus some other
groups sometimes to of course understand that Amy is fallible and make mistakes
can be wrong as an is not qualitatively about you anyone else can is a human as
anyone in fact we and we'll get into that we'll do all kinds of topics and
sciences explain everything in a way that everyone stand all of it by bit but
this is of course work I have to make to do I had it in the beginning then I
make a clean one and that's the one we do this next okay this is also a
movement that is friends you and I we want to with this improve the world this
is not just theoretical we're actually going to build tech we're going to talk
and the other thing I would ask you please after you've heard enough is to
reach out to other people that like to listen or talk let me go help me get on
to other see and the tech that we're going to build again all of it open
source and everything is going to automatically help solve the problem it
will be sort of unstoppable unless no one uses it of course that's a different
thing but there is a way people will be using it anyways it will be so
attractive economically to use the solution that there will be no stopping
the tsunami of freedom that we're going to start after which we will have all
socially for the movement yeah we are going to have a place to communicate and
the solution itself and various tools there's gonna be various tools that
we're gonna making so coming back to Wikipedia which was a while ago it turns
out so if you want to know about reliable knowledge or generally
ability of knowledge of knowledge reliability is studied is essentially
about errors how much error do you make when you you say you have knowledge how
reliable is it okay predict the future using your knowledge now let's wait and
look at the future let's look at the difference between the realization and
your prediction and your prediction versus the real realization that
difference is called the error and that is reliability if your error is small
your reliability is high so it's the inverse of the air
universe there see but negative or inverse of the air you could do the
power of minus one power of minus one prediction versus real and this study
this field is called statistic statistic statistics is the study of errors and
thereby of reliability notion if anyone claims something and statistics will
tell you how reliable that's for example as a simple rule of thumb if someone
says I asked one person and this person said favorite color is red its favorite
color is red I conclude from that the whole world has as its favorite color
red versus someone says I've asked 100 people and 100 out of 100 people said
favorite color red so I conclude the whole world has its favorite color as
red if that happened and if we believe this person that's another part of
course it can be a lie but let's say it were not a lie because we were there we
witnessed it example or it was recorded reliably so there's the transmission of
information and its reliability but assuming that was okay how reliable is
this information to make the conclusion that the whole world only loved it well
the first statement asking one person very unreliable statistics will actually
calculate for you the value a number that is not reliable but if you said a
hundred it becomes much more if actually a hundred humans said that then the
reliability would be quite high it wouldn't be perfect it's still possible
that and this is approximate um that in fact the whole world but it's possible
that you just met by coincidence a group of people under that shared this this
statistics and those nowadays that follow statistics the knowledge that
follow statistics and that the researchers scholars researchers that
follow statistics and science produce reliable knowledge because they use
reliability as a base philosophy only believe if it has good reason to believe
that includes because the statistics are telling us that it's reliable then that
knowledge is nowadays kept in white papers that's just kind of an agreement
that grew over time of those people that agree with this philosophy of using
reliability very closely at every step of the thought every small logical
step every conclusion made is deep in reliability drench in reliability based
in reliability there is a group of people worldwide large group from the
whole world amongst all the researchers there's a large group that follows there
is also group of researchers that does not follow this these principles of
statistics and reliability but they're still researchers they're trying to
figure out the world there we're all doing the same thing there's just
different schools of thought different ways of thinking there's a lot of
people researchers that are trying to figure out the world that are looking at
the world reading past knowledge can be from books can be from the internet
talking with people trying to figure out the patterns figuring out good knowledge
to predict the future and there's different schools and one of the major
schools is the one that is steeped in statistic use statistics to do all their
learning that's the school you will find if you for example worldwide if you
wanted in every world a representation of this school of thought you could ask
every government in the world what is your can you please share the name of
your premier University that University very likely and said and surely in most
of the world and in most of parts of the University each university can be large
and there can be some people that do things somehow differently but most for
the most part if not in some universities all the way they're not
accepted there is this basis the basis of statistics of using statistics for
reliability measure to only publish reliable information that is published
in white papers that's what white papers contain of course anyone can write
something on a white paper and call it a white paper of course but then the rules
of reliability are tested on the paper and if it is not acceptable by this
community of researchers and scholars that that are based on statistics then
they don't accept it they do not accept it as a white paper and these white
papers thus are considered by the group of researchers that rely on reliable
knowledge and by the way is there any is this a good name you know is it okay
that this community claims the name reliable knowledge and not a different
community well turns out as I said most things that most people value like being
able to get good food that depends on agricultural science and refrigerators
and being efficient in logistics so more people can have good food insulation
having good loads house that keep one warm and safe no matter the season the
internet computers and such satellites airplanes lots of things and medicine
lots of medicine that directly increases right if we ever argue about whether
something is positive has a positive impact or not we will always look at
health is the one thing that we can all agree is a good we all want more anyone
that is healthy wants more help it was that is unhealthy also wants all these
inventions like medicine that give us more health directly and others that
indirectly the internet allowing researchers to communicate more easily
to create medicine thereby indirectly then improving our health all these have
come from this community of researchers the ones that rely on statistics they
have created bones internet radios TVs medicine all kinds of medicine you name
it that you would find beneficial there are things that other people have come
up with but because they did not rely on reliability they did not care for
reliability as precisely or made some mistake in logic the other schools of
thought should not produce anything reliable example a phone where you send
a message and it arrives on the other side 99.999 percent of time that's
reliability it's very high reliability and so white papers by the way are not
easy to read typically you have to know about the subject to read the white
paper to understand to understand the white white papers are not easy to
understand to understand a white paper you typically have to know about the
subject the way the way we get white paper information summarized for non
expert audience if you're not it's a white paper on physics you're not a
physicist there are summaries of white piece me and these summaries are written
in encyclopedia is what an encyclopedia is it contains summaries of our reliable
knowledge which is in white papers and the largest and best that we know of is
Wikipedia it's an encyclopedia it's the largest one there's about 41 million
editors watching encyclopedia right someone can put in wrong information but
other people can correct it so whether you have good or bad information on in
such an open encyclopedia like Wikipedia depends on the ratio of good versus bad
actors are there more people in the world amongst these 41 million editors
that want to have correct information in this encyclopedia Wikipedia or more that
want wrong information this information to cause chaos in the world and from
what I have seen mostly it is definitely a strong ratio for the positive side for
the one interested in the truth that's why putting wrong information to
Wikipedia is quite difficult there there it's possible and it doesn't mean
Wikipedia is perfect so there can be and there very likely is wrong information
on Wikipedia some it can be something obscure and tiny topic that barely
anyone is watching possibly or a topic that is attacked by some group that
wants to inject this information and there's not enough people defending the
correct information yes by and large though there is no place with more
correct information available by and large on most topics science technology
philosophy you'll find no better place that summarizes white papers which is
reliable information and you should find references to white papers or other
sources and they have non white paper kind of sources too and they are marked
as you know how reliable are they and if you feel unsure whether Wikipedia is
giving you good information maybe you have a feeling it might not be true or
it's just important that you know the truth here then from Wikipedia you should
follow the reference go to a random article in English isn't there a random
let's search random they used to have random article I just take the very
first that there is that I see Legend of Zelda so you see this tiny these tiny
values you have to zoom here it says Oracle of Seasons and then there's this
a it's a link that's the reference and the reference goes further so you can
keep following the reference to try to figure out whether this possibly is not
good info but in the vast majority of cases there's so many humans watching
the pages anything inserted without good reference good new white papers that is
accepted by the community of researchers and scholars would be
immediately removed almost immediately was a slight exaggeration almost
immediately removed is short-lived that's why it is though not a perfect
source of information it is currently the best source we have and one of the
things that we will do eventually is bring Wikipedia to whether we make it
wiki3 so it's trustless there's no server servers needed those kinds of
things decentralized for each sensor this is actually the trustless truth
protocol as I mentioned award-winning and will be implemented at some point
but it's not one of the first things we will do and so just in light of
Wikipedia holding reliable information I chose it as the first page to start the
stream on nothing further okay let's take a short break I'm gonna put a BRB
I'm gonna mute my camera and mic and BRB
you
you
okay I am back now I realized during this time that the video the stream is
not as fast as it looks to me here locally it's only like snapshotting
that's unfortunate one way to solve that is of course having stronger hardware
which I cannot change right now the streams current bitrate is lower than
the recommended bitrate we recommend that you use a stream bitrate of 6800
kilo bit per second the connection is good but I don't know it's not quite
enough and Mike the computer is a little bit challenged right now
everything it's not much going on but with your bitrate you know what let's
just change it here apply okay maybe that will do something who knows okay
let's hope that's the case we are again there now okay so let's continue right
we were talking about our philosophy very important that you friend are
easily in this community and can freely exit that is or to a lot of the topics
we will discuss in the future and by the way there is a first largest human
rights oppression that we will tackle and after that the next and so on with
the goal of solving all social threats all social problems we it is actually
possible for us to be working against non having only non-human threats it is
possible to have only non-human threats imagine humanity had only non-human
threats there you and so let's show we we could we could do an X we could do an
X I'm gonna do many things so and this is using math science and text her and
this website and everything we're gonna get to and see why this is the solution
to the current Larsen suppression why that isn't yes could skip wanted however
it is very possible that the solution is confusing and no matter where you are in
the world there's many ways and dimensions people can be divided
typically people talk about for example the left right center then can have it
as a two-dimensional kind ranking authoritarianism and have a different
political spectrum no matter where you stand in fact I will explain why this
will leave us with social and freedom for all like freedom maximizing it is
freedom maximizing for society by maximizing actually also individual
freedom like as long as as long as
you
okay back yeah so I was saying no matter where you are on the spectrum or in
totally I was talking about political can be completely different kinds of
dimensions where you are on any kind of metric score you know what group you
belong to what your identities are it is very it is very possible that you would
be confused by the solution in its end form and would not understand
potentially how and why this is working and pro whom is this this is very pro
human and for all humans literally and especially a very large group that is
oppressed and not well represented this oppression it will surprise you but I'm
we're gonna show that even though we're in the year 2024 we will figure out
essentially that the most important and basic human right is the freedom of
thought and there's in fact 20 plus laws in the world that remove that right
using the worst punishment possible so let's make this more general first what
are we gonna do here we're gonna figure out what is the most let's put it like
this which laws and why laws well laws are important because laws are the
agreements in society that's what communities and societies agree are the
rules everyone has to follow why why because as I said we are all social
beings and as such for example like that like these two are not connected for
example social graph it's society that domains the planet friends we are a
social entity and it's a human society that dominates the planet that works so
the well-being of society should be maximized it turns out it is maximized
by maximizing individual freedom or individual freedom and individual
well-being as long can this conditional as long as society does not suffer as
long as it's good it's this is freedom for the individual maximized as long as
it doesn't hurt society maximizes society give people as much as possible
as long as they're not hurting society and you'll get the best society because
people will be happiest people freedom is always valuable has always positive
value what does it mean it's an extra option that's what freedom is freedom is
essentially if you want you could quantify it like how many of us what is
what is your freedom well that's the set of your options what options do you have
that's your freedom and having more freedom means having another option it
can always be ignored if it's not a good if you if your existing options are
already better you can just ignore the new option so that means more freedom
can never be worse can never be worse can only be better maybe it's the same
because this new option is not really useful but otherwise more freedom is
valuable positive value and so if you give people as much value as possible
by giving them as much freedom as possible as long as they don't hurt the
most important thing society and each individual might think and people
listening to me might think oh you're like but actually I care about myself
most or something or close by or something I you know I don't want to go
why society the most important well in fact that's who dominates that's who
decides society decides in fact society decides even who lives if society were
everyone but one person convinced that a certain person should die that person
will die right no person can escape the entire rest side no matter where you
essentially so that is just like the reality as the reality for other living
beings is that humans don't see well but it's human society right it was the team
of humans that defeated larger rivals for the dominance in some space it was
no human who was that much strong was the ability to be a team where does that
come from and we'll get into that but it has to do with trust nation and that is
then necessarily even though an individual doesn't like it it doesn't
change the fact that a society that don't and since every human is
essentially part of society some more some less but to some degree everyone
even by the gratefulness of just surviving into adulthood for example
right happens only that thanks to society and no human has ever survived after
birth completely alone there is no such human and even those that would go to
live and try to live alone come equipped with knowledge from society so if you
know you're part of society anyways might as well let's make the best
society let's make society better right there's a lot of pain that individuals
feel from society right think of mobs think of bullying that is mobs that
impose some kind of pain or the movement of freedom from individuals the answer
is to improve society because society at large actually wants to thrive society
would be happy if we had non internal threats abolish if society could find a
way to work together amongst all humans I'm talking human society and we're
gonna get to it at some point but we will also see how technically it's a
cyborg society because we're going to use technology always as we always human
plastic it's a cyber it's a separate topic that we'll get to some point and
human society would as any team the larger that a team the more potential
power they have the stronger they are if it's well trust is the main measure
characteristic going towards a good goal and imagine all of human society only
needing to worry about very difficult other problems and that is in fact
achievable and so laws are rules of society these are laws that try to
should try to maximize this individual freedom as long as it does not as long
as it does not you know hurt society okay when you have that then the
question is so or we understand that laws are the mechanism that society's
use to well incentivize behavior of individuals to motivate individuals
behave in a certain and let's find laws that go against this principle especially
the principle of maximized freedom as long as it doesn't hurt society and so
we're gonna look at which laws forbid forbid the most important or basic you
know like the most basic the most fundamental I already wrote it earlier
freedom of thought we'll get to it but more generally we're talking about which
laws forbid the most important the most basic rights okay with worst punishment
right like this yeah so if you have whenever you have a law you have two
things you have something that is not allowed or is allowed since we are
talking about restricting freedoms we are interested in the laws that do not
allow something so they forbid something but amongst the some things they could
forbid let's look at the worst thing they could forbid which is must be the
most basic which laws forbid the most basic that sought freedom of thought and
then laws have consequences laws have to have consequences because otherwise they
are not actually incentivizing behavior and usually the consequence even if a
law stipulates monetary fine for example if the person doesn't pay that fine will
you eventually do what to the person what is the worst punishment how far are
you gonna go to impose this behavior said incentivize earlier incentive and
then consequence felt is an imposition to that degree and so how strong you're
gonna impose it if you impose it using the worst punishment possible that's the
strongest imposition and that's the death but so if you have thought a death
penalty for thought crime that's essentially the worst type of law in
the world and we can get to that form it why that case we will at the end of
years have written up a formal theory of sociology use map but much more
important than that we will be causing action creating technology that will
incentivize change behavior socially to solve for this these laws to get rid of
these losses so we're gonna try to get rid of these laws that have a down to
flood crime and there's about 20 plus such as the movement part here well
that's the first big thing on this way to getting rid of these laws you know
that we're gonna be learning quite a bit creating technology you know
increasing our community and having a good time so that's in case you skip a
sort of head but in what I wanted to say also is that likely it's possible no
matter where you stand you would be confused by the solution at this moment
if you don't follow along so that's what we're gonna do okay let's get to the
next part I think I do want to because of course yeah I'll get to the statement
of the actual specific human rights group that we are gonna or human group
that we're going to help with the human rights
I just noticed something to know why there's a black line bottom candy that's
just all right okay let's yeah I was gonna write something on X it's gonna
write imagine humanity only needed to worry about non-human threats and I
will add saying to this stream yes and I need some because I have no followers
this is this is a zero zero catch X X is you'll see why that solves human
rights you guys should yeah I should think I might written this once based
okay it is X Muslim is from Muslim so we're using even though we're starting
more generally the topics we're using this initial recording with the
foreshadow already so if there's views on this all the views that come on this
say like this all the views that get here later should have a connection
that's why I put the cure and I put the QR code should talk about it even though
we haven't reached the point where I think on X if you post quite a bit and
follows zero okay and fine and it looks like I've solved the streaming the bit
ratio I'm gonna come to the next part which is about me with my okay so I am
many things there's many identities many adjectives such and tags that can be
used to identify me with and we'll get over time but we will need the important
bit about this who am I is worse with the goal of establish us its goal here I
am already public though I am going live and public as a human rights of us today
but I have had public toss and such on other tests and have published some
things I am overall saw I've studied a lot my topics I've mentioned early I
highly empathetic I am doing this as a world citizen of course but I can tell
you that I am in a location of course I'm just thinking by the way how to know
that I am not looking in the camera that should that's like something
currently in February 2024 face swapping does not work at this level live on
YouTube and like that can't do it yet so this is me I've been more professional
in industry doing technical things and my favorite part was academia I enjoy
that was a very nice part of it and was too short but the best part and I did
very well in all parts of my life and essentially besides being a scholar I am
also a teacher I really enjoy teaching and this is also what I am doing so I
here though this is a movement and a community in the community we will learn
a lot as I said and so of all the many things that I have learned I am going to
reach them and and the good thing about my teachings is that they are based and
can be traced logic and are reliable reliability based on logic because I
studied logic so I know it well and I know that many people in the world have
of course everyone needs and it is good to have teacher and a lot of people have
chosen questionable teachers even criminals and I feel sorry that I did
not provide my teachings sooner like this publicly I have two people around
most people have been positive about it and I've had students and some and so to
provide also a positive example to people that can relate or and anyone
else who is willing to listen and learn you should and that is called
open-mindedness I'm open-minded very open-minded right so open-minded means
you're open to looking consuming different information considering you
should not take it as a belief you should examine it good information bad
information like more true or false what was I think you can add other
information what do others think perhaps other information read somewhere have a
look is this good information if yes then you take it right and open-minded
means well you take it because it's better information that's just you being
optimizing for yourself right if you want to optimize and be your best self
should always have the best information in your mind right but if you can
assume some information and it turns out to be better than the information that
you have had so far and being open-minded again being self optimizing
means always taking the best information and considering the belief with the best
reason the best information at all times that you have access to being
open-minded is being open to consuming and receiving new information different
information the more open-minded you are the more you are open to looking at
different look at it and then if you are if you have your own cell in mind and
everyone else integrity for yourself then you should always believe in that
which is best which makes most sense which has the best reason for reasons
for best information you have found is what you should always be even though we
used to believe something else that's part of learning learning learning the
allowing yourself to learn is always believing what makes most sense being
open-minded is being and consuming new information so if you are open-minded I
am open-minded that if you present me information that makes more sense and
sense means logic and reliability higher reliability or you show me a logical
mistake my thinking my knowledge and yours does not I will quickly soon as I
checked everything I will then immediately change my mind and that is
that is you know high open-mindedness and people are scale open-mindedness and
you are open then the longer you listen to me the more you will find that I'm
happy to do more you know AMA's and all that stuff answer more questions I don't
know what should I say about myself more than that so maybe that's it and let's
perhaps let's see how long have we been just saying could let's let this be the
head we could as different things talk about fix and stuff okay here's one more
topic before I come I mean soon I might come then to the actual first subject
that people should urgently care about because the rest what I'm saying oh it's
interesting philosophical and such is urgency well if you heard what I said at
some points actually yes there's a lot of urgency in the sense that there's a
lot of other threats that we should focusing on and not needing to focus on
humans and as utopian as that sounds possible and we're going to show why
before I come to that maybe I'll make a short segue on I was thinking to do the
centralization a little bit already talked about maybe that's all the topics
I've mentioned we'll get to all of them in more depths over today is like the
introductory day but we have to also come to this QR code why it is and I
would have enjoyed to do actually do not come to this QR code for two years talk
about all the philosophy science teach everything and then land upon this as as
I did however I believe it's urgent friends you also like me need to join
and put energy towards this movement this is important and it needs all our
support maybe then I should mention because if you go to the QR code you
will see you will see ways to contribute besides one way to contribute I explained
earlier is if you comment anywhere this number that you see here the long number
this is the time stamp if you comment anywhere the number like whatever it is
four four three hold on some other number some larger number then we will
automatically make a short out of this so that's how you can easily help but
then another way to help is by transferring energy this movement needs
energy and energy is get on that let's talk about energy and information these
two things are the two most basic and fundamental things that we know exist we
know this from physics where we learn that information is something that can
be created and never destroyed cannot destroy information and what is
information or what is not information in fact everything that you see around
you everything that you think you yourself abstract concepts or tangible
ones are all information all information everything around you is information and
information needs energy to exist in this reality be instantiate need energy
and we always have access to finite amount of energy ever more as a planet
but information in this reality can only exist with energy but when that energy
is for example a pen is information if broken not considering maybe tiny parts
that fly away let's say nothing fly immediate perfect break then the energy
of the two pieces is the same but the information is different not a pen any
broken two different pieces each single piece also its own information the
energy is the same the information has changed well what about the original
information of the pen where's that doesn't exist in this reality anymore it
doesn't occupy any energy in our reality but we know it cannot be destroyed and
by the way from where do we know this this is the newest and best knowledge we
have in the science which is quantum physics tells us that information can so
it must keep existing somewhere some quantum realm somewhere information
keeps existing good news then that means all information putting you to me
including our soul and will define that word there's a clean clear definition
for all such terms that you've been using it if you get they all keep
existing forever because information cannot be destroyed great and energy is
what we need to exist well just the same as any information we said in which form
do we consume energy mostly food that's what we call food and that is energy and
well is that energy maybe I should add maybe I should add energy energy is the
same as mass this is the famous equation from Einstein okay that energy and
matter mass is the same that mass is the same thing they can be converted to
anything that like your arm a chair anything can be converted into energy
and then into electrical and into heat energy can be made into something
tangible that is needed to make anything tangible that's again the energy and it's
stored in that tangible thing so you might think oh wait this is this is not
the formula famously it's like this but this is just some number the constant
and so this means it's proportional the two are proportional to each other
that's just add so if energy and matter is all the same it's so we can say
that's why we say energy fundamental thing that exists we consume energy
through eating and but so by the way we have systems processes that can get
energy out of certain molecules and materials not just anything everything
by the way that we can only eat what was alive means you have to kill to live
there's no other way you have to kill to live something you might be very
distance from the actual killing because you buy dead food but someone is killing
on your behalf you cannot eat stones you have to eat something that was once
that's for you to or you die and some some other alive beings that's what we
alive things on this planet so far every that we found has in common and because
we made up the same material and that material it's able to extract energy
from the same material and not just whatever and so we need energy and we
take it as food but we get food trading or we call money what is money we where
do we get the money maybe we got it from someone else very likely it came from
someone else someone else any transfer probably for some reason that we
exchanged something what was that exchange we might have told them so
giving them them some information or some energy given them them some
something sold them or told them did work or whatever reason once we had it
we could use it to buy to get energy I took a food and the food stored the
energy and we take it into our body that means money is the potential the access
to energy potential energy that you have access to just our it's how much the
more money you have the more power you have as in the more energy you could get
you want you want to do you have a certain amount of money you could
convince certain amount to jump up and down that would be energy that they will
be getting from you and they'll be using and you have created energy that will be
focused and transform the way you want it to you could buy our and have it
squish that's energy you've got a bunch of energy and you had to transform the
way you wished that is you have access to any help that's money and that is
traded and transferred from each other very easily if it's a social we modern
money is a social concept it can be money is a can be because society agrees
that it represents that makes and that makes it efficient and so modern systems
for example have such systems work through staking traditional society
similar you have a state you have some money hash of a state in the system
working if it didn't work if it collapsed people didn't believe in it
to yourself so I don't believe then others would maybe catch on and say I
don't believe it then your own money will lose value will be bad for you so
yours you have a state in the system modern systems they have that same way
where you literally state your money you're in networks that represent some
social system payments as they're in in a social system and that is really
efficient versus other kinds of more energy using currencies so some forms of
money are more energy efficient there's less energy efficient in any case what's
most important is that that money or energy power can be transferred that's
very poor the system come us we need out we need to make this work and currently
if you friends there's many ways you can help like I said you can help make
shorts by just commenting timestamp hold on timestamp and then comma I didn't
mention there if you can't really find out which one it's bigger but if you had
the time comma so any number whatever colon some other number comma some other
colon some other number whatever number then we will compact in these short clips
into a short so that's how you can help you can like share etc and you can
transfer us power directly and the most anonymous way do this you want to do it
completely anonymous using something called one errors that's completely
anonymous then side anonymous is BT is Bitcoin see and there's also EVM that's
a theory that based address and you'll find also credit card to a theory as a
credit card to one arrow link then you can have it also completely anonymous by
just adding your own XML count before you send it to the moon's amount when
you're out monero is a completely fresh storage and transfer of value it is
called and as I was calling her but anything and everything will do and we
will have to expand our community and get in our to create who convinced the
world saw to remove these 20 odd long keep the whole world hostage is the
hypothesis here there's 20 odd laws that using science and math have been
identified we have identified that could bring us to very high level complete
social vision not not full not complete a very high level it's the biggest chunk
that we could do and all we have to do is get rid of these totally inhumane
laws and to do that we're gonna use technology and economic incentives and
those incentives need to be fueled by power and so this is worse the heart you
know very important I helped also do it as as everyone can is there's many ways
supporting this and so with that perhaps I should come to the main topic I'll go
through it without maybe I'll take K interviews yeah it's okay all right I'm
thinking to take a short break and then when I come back we're gonna come to the
trip comment oh that's something else let's just see what it is and going to
okay um yeah let me take a break be are
you
you
you
you
you
you
okay let's continue let's continue so this above just a reminder of how easily
you can help friends by simply commenting two timestamps with a dash
for a clip and that's it that can be entire short or comma separated clips
that are put together to a short and now I think let's get to the first main human
rights oppression and why this is and just talk about so we said we're looking
for the worst the most basic human right the right the freedom of thought you
cannot think what you want to if you cannot think what you want to then you
are missing your autonomy you're not your own autonomous cell cannot choose
what you want to think then you are definitely someone's slave we could say
at you if you have to even think what someone else and you're not anonymous
and thoughts can be kept private sometimes and other times they become
known and there are laws nowadays that punish thought crime so you think the
wrong thing and you're punished for it and that means you don't have freedom to
think whatever you want to think and so those laws are robbing people of their
most basic right there used to be more such law and now there's less and
there's still some 20 odd such laws left that we found that targets a specific
group of people a large group very large a good number of them perhaps more than
half also use the death penalty which is the worst type punish awesome so it's
the most basic right with a worst punishment the most busy right taken
away using the worst but that's the worst type possible and indeed we have
identified a group of almost 2 billion almost 2 billion human that and 20 plus
laws okay that take away freedom on these 20 odd laws take away the freedom
of thought of around almost 2 billion people at the same time it's not talked
about could do just to symbolize a quiet taboo topic but 2 billion people have
no freedom of thought taken away by 20 odd laws around the world that sounds
like it should be a very big talk oh you know should that be a taboo what about
taboos on their own by the way should we have taboos what is the purpose of
to this what is it taboo have you ever heard the term taboo if it's a new term
it's something that it's part of sociology again so sociology is a
science of human social structures so if you have humans and some structures this
is the connection so the dots are the humans connections are social connect
it's trust and communication chat between the humans and a taboo is a
topic that is not liked to be discussed by a majority of the society
individually some topic whatever it is people if at all maybe can be discussed
one-on-one maybe not even but the more people there are the less it would be
discussed the more of a taboo that topics and ironically taboos are
completely negative down minus minus sign for society because actually we
know that society itself by the way is information right because everything is
information individual humans are information everything that's happening
actually everything that's told everything that's changed all
information most abstract so all the time what it is is exchange of
information information is being created change and such and that low of
information the more information can flow the better the more complex new
information can be created and we'll talk about what complexity is a formation
very important metric quantify and summarizes in the sense one
dimensionally information one sense and is central to a lot of things and
complexity of information has indeed been growing and most things you would
consider progress would involve having higher complexity information okay and
we also know from microeconomics that a fair trade okay is beneficial for both
sides okay if you have a fair trade both sides win so the more it's something
interesting that just happened the more fair trading there is in the world the
better off all sides and we see that in the open markets markets that are open
also well regulated to provide fairs can have here it then fair trade great
and so both win and we are doing that constantly with information as well
society we're trading information and if we trade well our whole society will do
better the more we have information around the more we've been able to
invent more medicine better technology generally the more information has
slowed around so reliable information good information is also key and one of
the major things we will work on here together and a taboo blocks information
for taboo is it's like it's a blockage something is not flowing anymore you
have less information flow society is worse but is it some reason that it's a
taboo it's individually for the individual it is highly costly like
embarrassing awkward maybe even more cost to those that are perhaps some kind
of abusers protected by a taboo often the case that those that have power and
abuse will create a taboo so that their abuse is not made visible whatever that
is and society suffers for society it's a minus taboos are a minus for society
society would be actually should and so our community has no taboos no taboos
and free society should try it's you can ignore it that discussions of certain
topics will cause some emotions that you might feel are undesirable but if they
will be caused they should be had and dealt with rather than ignore if
something cannot be talked about the question is why not there's usually a
good reason for that okay
what did we all right we're talking about that we have two billion people
with no make a different color no freedom of thought that's right it's
short new spelling that seems does that could that be real do you think seems
exaggerated and at the same time taboo as in not talked about right that's
weird if true let's let's do this now we're gonna use our imagination now by
the way the imagination there was a very nice animation once a spongebob
imagination can do anything why is imagination important it's about the
open-minded it's about considering other information okay this is the same as
having an open mind that is opening as in thinking something else something
that might not be true or something that is not true even even untrue things
that's so important sometimes I have heard some humans say why should I
imagine untrue anyway but that's actually then you otherwise you're
saying let's not imagine imagining is very often thinking of untrue things
but there's a reason to think them the same reason as there is in reading and
hearing of fictional stories they're not true that's why they called fictional
but there is valuable information in them there is a lesson there is a nice
saying those that ignore history repeat the mistakes one has to learn and the
learning of good information can come in the form of an analogy a story and that
can be fictional but highly effective and can thus only work if generally the
concept of imagination is used right wondering it's not it's not easy to see
which layer is the is which is too small the thumbnail or not zoomable this
done I'm just gonna mute okay back and so we're talking about does this not
seem exaggerated we're gonna say let's imagine it was true we know now why
imagination important imagine it were true and imagine it was also true
additionally as I said that who hasn't not talked about but there's a actually
2 billion people currently trapped without freedom of kept by a 20-plus
laws around the world by the government's by local government different
jurisdictions if these 20-plus laws are broken cancelled by society 2 billion
people gain freedom of thought that imagine that were true and I'm saying
that is true and I'll show that soon explain it then it should be the most
important topic is it not my friends I think this is the one this is there is
no larger and tell you there is no larger group that has that basic a
fundamental a right taken away from itself this is one that will resolve
largest and a very big chunk of all social conflict and then will come the
next next biggest until humanity has only non-human threats okay so since
this is important here if this is true let's you know get rid of what what is
this going on make a few more duplicates okay all right so I'm going to now come
to the point of talk talking about the specific group that is currently under
the largest oppression and to the source of it and the solution of it this is
don't forget a human rights human rights sociology as formal sociology to to be
honest to clarify we are formulating sociological theorems here the long term
not today we're stating them anyways so it turns out that
yes this largest group that is being denied its most basic human rights is
group this is a group of humans almost 2 billion humans worldwide and they in
these 20 plus laws deny are denied they're their choice to be
Muslim yeah that's very surprising isn't it it's so weird these 20 plus laws in
the world that remove the choice from a group as large as nearly 2 billion
people to choose whether choose to be Muslim or not to be Muslim just the same
choice that choice is the choice of belief of thought you want to believe
something you should be able to say in the world I want to be a Muslim should
be able to say that from your own choice and similarly you should be able to say
I don't want to be both directions have to exist for either to exist otherwise
you have no choice so these 20 odd laws the way they are written what they are
forbidding is the choice to be ex-Muslim yeah that's what the law is saying is
not allowed and ironically that takes away everyone's right to choose in any
direction so now it depends on which way you think where you lie on different
spectrums how you would understand and think about this and I'll explain it
from your perspective depending on what it is if you are Muslim you should be
very unhappy about why can you not if you want to be let's say if you want to
be want to be Muslim and you should have the right to openly say really really
say that you want to be a Muslim however right now as it stands these
laws don't allow you you probably didn't know that you probably didn't
realize that these laws forbid you from really saying that you could say it but
other people would say you know we can't really believe you because we know that
the laws are forcing you to have to say according to the laws force that's not a
choice or we don't know you know I want to believe you want to be real totally
want to be a Muslim want to believe you if someone says let's let's say this
someone who's saying I want to be say well okay I would love to believe you
but I know that there's 20 plus laws that force you to say that so I don't
know whether you actually mean it or not your choice has been stolen if you
want to be an ex-Muslim of course then it's the laws are bad because they're
not letting you be what you want to be it's not that you cannot convince people
of what you want to be but you just are not allowed to be what you want to be
but then let's say you have nothing you're outside right you are never
Muslim then if you like Muslims right if you like Muslims then maybe on this side
and there's some neutral parties boy the other side that dislike Muslims side
right say if you let's do the first one so if you like Muslims then you're
outraged why are there laws that forbid Muslims from having their freedom the
freedom to choose to be Muslim or not and maybe back and forth freedom of
thought freedom to believe what one wants and even change one's mind as one
is allowed to learn so why can't I change my mind what if I want to change
my mind ten times a day so what's it to you it's in my mind so there should be
no law forbidding me from changing my mind in either direction and so this is
very unliberal very intrusive and you should stand up against this this should
be the largest issue to work on and if you dislike or let me do the neutral
first right if you if you're neutral then same thing goes still there's almost two
billion people there's almost one in four people that do not have their most
basic human right and that stresses them right so me yeah and so now let me jump
with that so the new if you're neutral you should want to tell people generally
anyways if you dislike Muslims then maybe you're thinking you know why are
they always so it seems there's so much stress going on right there's conflict
there's issues what is going on and think if you didn't have your most
basic freedom if you couldn't express yourself and say yes I want to be you
know actually almost and everyone around you would say like yes we believe you
but instead in this world everyone around you says we can't believe you
because we know you're being forced this is a statement under duress we can't
believe it so you can't be that you can't be the opposite you can't say that you
know what no I don't want to be Muslim anymore I used to be but I don't know I
don't want to be both is not possible that means you have a big stress in your
mind because you either cannot be yourself or no one believes you X or no
one believes you cannot be yourself X or no one believes you that is stressful
and then under such stress and every stress brings out worse behaviors in
every anyone and so if you want an improvement in the situation situations
or world all kinds of situations micro and macro you should want to help this
group dissolve that stress and sometimes if your neighbor has a problem that you
recognize and the neighbor doesn't you have two choices get involved or not but
if it's problematic and causing stress and causing issues then you should not
be too shy to help from outside in fact sometimes it's very important if you are
thinking should I be in this community and friends I'm telling you yes you
should be everyone should be and there's reasons for every this is very important
and can you imagine a world where such basic rights were available to people we
would could do so much more so this is this is the another flag of the movement
you can think of yourselves as we can think of ourselves as pirates and our
goal my goal is to be king of the pirates Luffy following a journey to be listened
to most to avoid a very difficult future there should be nobody in the world in
theory that would protect these laws who standing in the way of two billion
Muslims to have their right they want to prove themselves they have free will
given and so if you don't if other humans are stopping and these are all
human laws human-made laws these are human-made laws around the world that
take away the basic freedom God given the freedom to that term also will by
the way will define all these terms that I've been just saying just now I can get
to it here on top by the way we said everything is information right well what
if we took the union of all information that's everything combined everything
everything you can think of right every thought every video every person every
rock every star every information that exists every inform that has ever been
created this reality or even every reality that exists all information
union so this this one is sign of a for union it's when you so we have let's say
groups of different groups right different bags if you put them all
together into one bag it's a union of all the bags all together the union of
all information what what would we call the union of all information what have
we been calling such an entity and the union of any information is again
information is also information some other information but so we know this is
some kind of information what have we been calling this information humans for
so long what is that which is everyone is everything everything together what
what if at all God for a long time many people have called and then you can also
see that in fact any human is also information it means any human is a
subset as information any information is the subset of the union of all
information of course it's true any information is a subset of all
information unionized so we're all part of God and we all communicate with God
all the information that we exchange back and forth that makes us all into
prophets we are all in fact and beware those that lame exclusivity to God fact
we are all communicating all the time with God is defined here and prayer also
works if defined as effort put towards changing the environment to a goal
target environment that we want our wish it does begin with do have to first
thing I wish that something was like this that's the lowest that's the lowest
form of prayer the lowest effort but it is always the first effort it is
necessary what did I
okay let's get back here prophets prayer thinking is the lowest effort if
thinking can lead to doing that's a higher effort that has a higher chance
of working higher chance of changing getting God to that is all information
having information all the environment to change towards what we would rather
prayer is effort is doing starts with thinking the more you think the more you
do the more the more you have a chance of your prayer to be heard by God this
is now sort of an autonomous definition of God natural signal and one that works
with the intuitive and linguistic expressions we have used these terms in
and that then should in theory if we write it out with all formalism convert
and make us it should that would be at least but you don't you cannot pray and
a sure chance of change even the planet we cannot pray hard in Australia or
something maybe in the future and some point we probably have you right but
currently we cannot so it's we know prayer doesn't work but it works more
the more you pray as in the more effort you may hire it starts with thinking
that was a good first step for many theories prayer system hypothesis even
theories here's a better the more you do towards your goal prayer you know the
more you pray the more effort you put more likely the world get there for you
yes so it is a God-given right with the correct definitions and terminology you
could all agree and it is being denied by some humans and these should be very
few if we said everyone sit down who thinks this law is we should have you
people stand remaining standing those few on the way to the power to change
that so each of these laws when you have a law you have a law then there are we
could rank people in order of ability to change it okay this ordering is ability
to change the law and everyone in the world can be in that ranking right so we
said there's 20 plus laws let's pick one and choose one of them and we order
everyone in the world according to their ability to change that law and you know
in some places really there's one person could just change it in other places
there has to be root but even within that group there's sort of a power
hierarchy apps like of influence so we could get some kind ordering and in
theory and here now we ask imagine you guys are also everyone standing in this
line everyone ordered in this way the whole world we're imagining and we say
everyone that thinks these laws need to disappear ASAP sit down so who remains
standing right maybe some people who knows where we're but you know maybe
some people just sit down and then we look at who's remaining standing and
that is the one we have to convince and I'm saying think about it cannot be many
people who would remain standing to defend these laws that take away the
most basic human right of so many people of the group of most two nearly two
billion people that's not okay so we would convince few people in fact I
claim the whole world could if it get got together in around a month put so
much social pressure on these few individuals for each law for a law or
all of them for the laws to be gone and when these laws are gone the world will
have a lot more social calm if every fourth person as freedom must be the
case now here's how we are going to get that to happen because that does sound
like in theory if the whole world did it it's not even that the whole world would
agree they could quickly change we could quickly got get through it but how you
friends and me with our current limited always limited but we cannot have yet
the world we don't have the same powers how can we get here comes a solution
first of all to understand is the hashtag summarizing the whole thinking
is that X most is promos okay it's the same thing both are restricted by the
same law that forbids both of them to make their choice because it is illegal
to be an ex-muslim no one can choose to be a Muslim both is true you cannot have
one without the other if you allow people to be ex-muslim then you allow
people to choose to be Muslim and wouldn't you rather be with people that
are not faking yes you want to be in a group of people that that you get along
with agree with and that are not fake lying you want these laws gone no matter
who you are which side you're on so these laws are there used to be more
such laws now 20 plus left around the world and and there used to be a lot
more laws like this now there's 20 plus left that's good there should be zero
and there should be zero such laws and how do we get there these laws actually
are outrageous thought crime death penalty two billion people outrageous
why does it even exist why can that be it's because it is unknown people don't
know that's why is it not known well on the one hand it's a taboo as shown here
and there is because these laws are brutal there are some people defending
these laws that would defend these laws and they tend to be violent and so
people don't want us but the vast majority of the world should agree that
they should go they need to go right any human rights organization needs to
agree that this is not two billion people 20 laws no freedom of thought no
choice that's weird so yeah 22 billion people death penalty in 2024 shouldn't be
so all we need to do is maximize awareness if something is ridiculous to
exist this kind of law they can only exist if people don't know people knew
about then it would be stop should be the first thing stop ex-muslim is pro
Muslim summarizes this whole idea is a hashtag and of course the more second
form the shortest form to talk about this whole lot a problem is the symbol
x-mas that's the shortest form that's you know zoom I'm gonna change my thing
here to display but that's okay then and so if I zoom now I think this is the
main symbol that represents this issue of not giving Muslims their most basic
human right and so the solution to raise awareness is a completely decentralized
system that contains power energy we can call it energy because it's not energy
is power but it gives us access to energies money funds coins ever you want
to call it lives autonomous decentralized so that means no one has
undue access not even I know no one can have it and it's open source it will be
audited it will be open source audited and it pays anyone that will raise
awareness by disseminating this simply so anyone can do anything you can
graffiti on a wall right you could we write a bit nicer you could yeah you
could graffiti on a wall you could go into a mall open the laptop in the shop
computer shop write it on the text editor the symbol symbols x-mas ex-mus
and just leave it there and walk away take a picture yourself you could write
it on a piece of paper hang it some so no one needs to see you you could tweet
instead you could write it in a comment post anywhere and then you submit proof
any art you could call it call it art you will submit proof and you will
yourself chooses the value what it's worth and the community is going to hold
as a vote Democrat and it'll vote yes or no one or zero yes or yes you get the
value and you've contributed to the world to raising awareness to this issue
and you got paid or no means your value was too high try a lower one so if we
look at this as a value thing now we didn't need the second this if this is a
value axis now then maybe the true value is here true value fair value or
something true fair value you should you don't know it exactly what it is you
should try to estimate it what do you think and then go too high you start
here community should say no so you're encouraged to start higher then go lower
no and some point the community says yes and then that's what you're paid and
it's gonna be close to the true value this mechanism will allow us to get
close to the true value without incurring large costs by the community
of a simple yes no vote at the same time allowing for valuation of complex
arbitrary acts of activism right where you're raising awareness you've created
maybe you've rented a billboard management then the value is really high
you can ask for more sure right and the community will say yes or no and the
easiest way so you can be an activist like that you can earn my points money
I'm talking about real like dollars holds Bitcoin whatever any coin people
donate what goes in here is the donation that's an even easier way of activism
when you donate in here then it creates an incentive for someone else to
actually go and create the symbol somewhere as art and maximize the views
it gets which sort of should correlate with the value right the more views the
more value people get paid for it if you donate you get people to do activism and
it's all democratic and autonomous decentralized so it can be trustless
everyone can donate with knowing no one can misuse the funds or or steal them
whilst it's maximizing for the community's voting for the intent that
is in this case symbol ex-muslim of course this technology can be used for
raising awareness of any cause and any symbol and it could theoretically become
a battleground of these smart contracts that you know that hold these funds
which one is the bigger one of two different competing causes because
that's gonna have people see that symbol more around the world of Instagram's can
be a very this is a very efficient potential battleground of ideas okay to
contribute please go to the website and follow this Monero is the completely
anonymous way can do it with a card get yourself Monero and if you instead of
from the card you could send it directly to it instead send it to your sellers
and so you could use something like cake wallet right we have no affiliation with
any of these things we will be building sometime in the future but this is
existing and good technology cake wallet you can have Bitcoin and Monero and
everything and it's self custodial that means you own on your phone and should
keep that safe course you can create a Monero account your for yourself have
it sent from your visa to there first and then from there to us for there to
be literally no trace right once you're transacting Moneros from from Monero to
Monero address it's completely privacy preserving there's nothing alternatively
you can also just send Bitcoin which is side on us depends whether you have
connected your identity or not and whether you care about that in this case
or not all is welcome all support open support anonymous support all welcome
and this is an ethereum address that works of course on any EVM based network
any L2 everything would be the same and we are human rights activists doing this
to maximize freedom please share it and here is an email you can find so you can
write something like if you for example sent some coins on some weird EVM based
chain then it would be good if you let us know so we look so this is how it's
going to work and as I explained a few times simplest way to contribute just
timestamp begin colon timestamp end a timestamp are these numbers the big
numbers here if you just anywhere comment with two numbers and some number here
colon some number here that will help create shorts that they'll create the
short automatically so if you find some spot interesting you know just rewind a
little bit look at that number jot it down have it run jot it down and
comment with that that's like very cool help because short content is absolutely
very important for us to reach a broader audience rent and you know I we can hang
out a lot we can talk a lot I'm sure when if you have nothing more important
to do you'll gladly just hang out and talk and can talk about any topic and
have anything explained at the same time we have our first actionable project the
most important one for the world right this would undoubtedly be the fallout
tsunami tsunami is even destructive right but after the tsunami you have a
calm that the world would sigh a relief and you know it can take some time for
the calm to hit but it will and all you have to do is one of those things like
it share this contribute if you can talk about it it should occupy your mind some
budget some weekly budget you can think how much per week did I put it's 52
weeks in the year each week how much towards this because this is the most
important social cost there's larger non-social problems how would I list some
that come to mind I mean we have we have a climate crisis by the way I know
there's some people who don't or in disagreement is it a crisis is it human
made or not by the way on the human made part even if it were not accelerated by
humans part of it is now the tissue in climate if we recognize that the effect
would be detrimental to our lives right if we just knew whether it's whether
humans made it worse or not but see that was gonna rise and so a lot of people
will be displaced there will be a lot of damage should we then not put effort
into trying to figure it out and try to reduce it yes we should write to make
life better for in fact this is a major this is going to cause huge changes with
the potential of us creating coming up with the science and tech to counter it
faster and control the climate potentially we would have to control it
so well and it would the crisis would have to be so bad that people agree to
do to do that some people think it's already done there's no openly published
proof of that then there is a extinction event event coming we are we're in it
so to speak we're not at the peak of it but it looks like we're getting there
that is a high number of living beings just died just from the dynamics naturally
here again there is some evidence that humans have accelerated that further the
result in any case either case is the same that we're gonna have it much
harder grow food as we are used for a long time because a lot of insects are
going to disappear that's gonna be a problem few decades very noticeably
already sweet to some degree but this will this can be really bad there can be
of course some like astronomical kind of there are astronomical risks you know
large asteroids strong radiations expansions of the universe though you
know we have ideas that there's time but there are large risks and then of course
tiny microbes talking about viruses bacteria tiny enemies one can say in the
sense that they shouldn't say take it back because of course some are aligned
with us and others and others want to kill us it's so but they are threats
there are virus and bio threats and by the way you know this is just beginning
because people can alter DNA at home it since few years maybe a decade you can
buy a kit and make some more luminescent hacking the DNA of biochemical systems
that then intentions in unintentionally or maliciously can will eventually enough
time passes create a virus that will be highly infectious and high fatality and
if it has a late onset that's been the worst late onset high infectious rates
high fatality rates these are huge threats and all these threats are threats
to our health right the one thing that this all this threatens and that we all
agree is a good health and imagine humanity based only these threats it
would be already difficult currently we face a lot of internal that is human
threats humanity faces human threats there's humans that are working against
health in this world and that is not necessary and it is also not so to speak
their fault quote-unquote everyone is in product of its heritage and environment
everyone is comes from heritage and environment that gives a person and and
there is something all the chain of abuse that is very important all of this
okay this is the writers chain of use in the chain of abuse in fact let's take
away the first arrow everyone except the beginning and the end of the chain are
both victim first and abuser that's true in a chain any chain of abuse almost
everyone is both first a victim then an abuser and so it continues the chain
until if until someone stops it and that's the is a nice meme know why it's
always Andrew Yang and yeah maybe Andrew Yang meme chain of abuse it's a
mirror but maybe just look mind but there's a picture where you have a
grandfather shouting about shouting his and I thought it was angry I was keeping
the abuse and so the kid here is a first happy kid that's what you should aim to
be you should not you try to not forward your abuse even though it's not your
fault like you are a victim not your fault quote-unquote being an abuser is
negative crime behavior that is not good and you should base consequences for
being an abuser the reason you are an abuser and be not your possible that is
typically the case that is the case as in her people and less hurt people or
less people so it's very clear we can be more harmonious it is possible I have
seen this mechanism work so there is no justifying abuse but there is explaining
that explanation is the victimhood and so people that are going against health
in our society that are diminishing hell they are doing that because they were
once again it does not excuse their behavior but it explains it and we can
use the explanation to stop it from happening reduce it from that happening
in the future to others so if we understand for example that well two
billion people two million Muslims should not be forced to be just that one
way they should have their own rights they should be able to choose how they
want to be whether they would be want to choose to be Muslim or not be ex-Muslim
that right taken away is an abuse that is an abuse and it's an abuse on so many
people and it ends up causing a lot of downstream problems and if we follow
this plan we would remove these 20 laws and we would gain a lot of calm socially
I am sure okay what should we talk about now I've explained everything there's a
lot to do no but there are of course things in more detail that I can go into
and be cleaning I could take a
you
I'm wondering I'm not quite sure what's going on with the stream I just did
okay I'm gonna take a break
you
you
